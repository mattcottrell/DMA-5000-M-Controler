# DMA-5000-M-Controler
Graphical User Interface Software Coordinating DMA Instrument Control and Data Curation In Google Sheets

This is source code for a Xojo programming language project that relies on the Chilkat API for communicating with Google sheets.  The sofware presents a graphical user interface for collecting daily brewery cellar data using an Anton Paar DMA 500 M density meter and an Alcolyzer module that measures alcohol content.  Data are saved to a cellar log file in Google sheets. A separate sheet summarizes the cellar log in a format that presents the current state of fermentation for all of the vessels in the cellar.
